## Overview
**My-Basic-Rental-Photo-Studio-Project** is a simple photo studio rental program developed using the Python and several libraries. 
The program will display images and descriptions of the selected photo studio and then make a reservation according to the rental price based on the description and duration entered.
The program also has a reminder that will sound an alarm if the rental time has expired. 
In addition, the program also provides visualization based on the income from each photo studio theme so that the comparison between actual and target income can be seen through a bar chart using numpy and matplotlib. 
Run this program from the main file.
